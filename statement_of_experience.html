    <h1>Statement of Experience</h1>
    <p>In this section, I want to provide a more complete overview of my skills than you'll find on
    my CV. I mainly do backend Web development right now, but I consider myself a generalist and
    have taken on a variety of software development projects at both professional and personal
    levels.</p>
    <h2>PHP</h2>
    <p>I've worked heavily with PHP since 2005. I've built a lot of things with it, some without a
    framework and some with Laravel/Lumen. If it can be done in PHP, I can probably do it.</p>
    <h2>JavaScript / TypeScript</h2>
    <p>I've worked with JavaScript for many years, sometimes quite heavily.</p>
    <p>In the past, I wrote a lot of lines of vanilla JS, jQuery, and <a href=
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUI_Library" target="_blank">YUI</a> (ah, memories) for the
    browser. In the last few years, I've been using TypeScript with the <a href=
    "https://nestjs.com/" target="_blank">NestJS</a> framework to create backend services.</p>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>Java used to be my best language, but I haven't worked with it recently in a professional
    setting. A little while back, I used it to study concurrent programming in an online
    course.</p>
    <h2>Other Languages</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h5>Perl</h5>
        <p>I did a lot of work in Perl for around 6 years. It was my main "backend" language due to
        its large number of modules which included good database support and graphing
        capabilities.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>C++</h5>
        <p>I used C++ extensively in college, but not much since then.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h5>PostScript</h5>
        <p>I include this as a bit of a joke, but I really did learn PostScript so that I could
        create a performant HTML-to-PDF converter many years ago. I still consider it one of my
        best hacks.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Architecture</h2>
    <p>I have experience building monoliths and tearing them down into a service architecture. I've
    designed and built event-based systems using RabbitMQ as a message broker. I've designed
    numerous APIs. I've worked with Docker and Kubernetes since 2017.</p>
    <h2>Databases</h2>
