		<h3>1. Nail&nbsp;Clippers</h3>
<p><img alt="nail clippers" src="https://jeremybuchmann.com/images/nail-clippers.jpg"></p>
<p>I have a confession to make. I can&#8217;t type. Never learned. Most
programmers I&#8217;ve known couldn&#8217;t type either, which is weird. You&#8217;d think
it&#8217;d be the first thing we learned. Even though the number of symbols in
code makes touch typing a little less effective (so I&#8217;ve been told), we
still have to write documentation which is mostly words (you are writing
documentation, right? Good.) Even though I can&#8217;t type, I&#8217;m a pretty fast
hunter-and-pecker. But what really kills my accuracy and speed is when
my fingernails get long enough to get in the way. Keep those babies
trimmed and those fingers&nbsp;flying.</p>
<h3>2. A Good&nbsp;Chair</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that you want to be comfortable while you work.
Some people are doing the
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5830748/why-i-switched-my-office-chair-with-an-exercise-ball-and-what-it-feels-like">exercise-ball-as-a-chair</a>
thing while others are going for the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5735528/why-and-how-i-switched-to-a-standing-desk">standing
desk</a>.
But most of us sit in chairs, and chairs vary widely in&nbsp;quality.</p>
<p>I remember starting a new job some years back and when I was shown to my
desk, the chair was an old, worn out task chair that was missing a bolt
in the backrest which caused the backrest to hang down 90 degrees from
where it was supposed to be. It was the only chair they had for me and
let me tell you, it wasn&#8217;t a pleasant way to spend eight&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p><img alt="chair" src="https://jeremybuchmann.com/images/chair.jpg">
This is not the chair you&#8217;re looking&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>There are a
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/07/investing-in-a-quality-programming-chair.html">ton</a>
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2006/12/28/workspace-roundup-ergonomic-chairs/">of</a>
<a href="http://ehs.unc.edu/workplace_safety/ergonomics/chairs/">options</a> out
there for the new chair buyer, but if you find all of those options
lacking, you could <a href="http://www.arrickrobotics.com/chair/">make your own computer chair from a luxury car
seat</a>.</p>
<h3>3.&nbsp;Coaster</h3>
<p>Do you have a lot of papers scattered on your desk? And have you ever
set a cold drink down, not realizing you were setting it down on
something you were going to give to someone else? I bet they
didn&#8217;t appreciate the nice wet ring on that report. Easy solution: a
coaster. Aside from allowing you to show off a little
<a href="http://www.thegreenhead.com/2007/11/lego-coaster-set.php">personality</a>
or <a href="https://www.cafepress.co.uk/+funny+coasters">sense of
humor</a>, it
carves out a little spot on your desk just for that bottle of Diet Mr&nbsp;Pibb.</p>
<p><img alt="coaster" src="https://jeremybuchmann.com/images/coaster.jpg"></p>
<h3>4. Hand&nbsp;Lotion</h3>
<p>Working in Reno where it&#8217;s not unusual to have single-digit humidity, my
hands dry out to the point that <em>I can&#8217;t stretch my fingers fast enough
to maintain my normal typing speed</em>. A little hand lotion goes a long
way toward keeping that word count&nbsp;high.</p>
<p><img alt="lotion bottle" src="https://jeremybuchmann.com/images/lotion.jpg"></p>
<h3>5. Printed <span class="caps">ASCII</span>&nbsp;Chart</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve kept one of these on my wall for as long as I can remember. I just
used it the other day to troubleshoot some incorrectly encoded data we
were trying to import into our database. Good times with my old&nbsp;friend.</p>
<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII-Table.svg"><img alt="ASCII chart" src="https://jeremybuchmann.com/images/ascii-table.png"></a></p>
<h3>Bonus:&nbsp;Plants</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re the type that likes to work in a &#8220;hacker cave&#8221; (like a
man-cave, but for nerds&#8230;<span class="caps">BTW</span>, how great of a show would that be&#8230;are
you listening <span class="caps">HGTV</span>?), you may want to look into a little houseplant. Any
old plant will do, but did you know that there are plants that are
especially good at cleaning the air? <a href="http://www.extension.umn.edu/yardandgarden/ygbriefs/h110indoorair.html">It&#8217;s
true</a>.</p>
