		<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/">Spaceballs</a> was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Its juvenile, 4th-wall breaking humor was endlessly entertaining to a 10 year-old me. My friend and I even had the final duel scene between Dark Helmet and Lone Starr memorized so well that we would act it out at the beginning of PE class when the instructors were trying to get all us kids lined up for calisthenics.</p>
<p>I recently watched the movie again for some nostalgic laughs. Although there are a few bits that haven't aged well, I think that overall, the movie holds up. But there was one joke toward the end that really jumped out at me as being very timely.</p>
