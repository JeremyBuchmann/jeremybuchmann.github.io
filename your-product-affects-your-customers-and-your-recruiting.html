		<p>Recently, I had a recruiter ask whether I was interested in a job at a large software company whose product I had used in the past. This product is a Really Big piece of software that required several training classes to learn how it worked and how to integrate it with other systems.</p>
<p>The product itself was...mostly okay-ish. It was a business-flow product designed to meet the needs of almost any large organization, so it was enourmous, slow, confusing, tedious, and all the other things you think of when you think of these types of products.</p>
<p>I don't remember how many courses I took to be able to work with the product, but I distinctly remember a situation where we were learning how to set up an integration or export process, and there was a form full of options to choose. One of the options had a drop-down of possible values like:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSV</li>
<li>JSON</li>
<li>new CSV</li>
<li>CSV</li>
<li>XML</li>
</ul>
<p>and I remember the trainer, fully aware of how ridiculous this was, said "Now, this is kind of silly, but you need to pick the second CSV, not the first one, and not the new one. Just remember, choose the second CSV option if you want CSV."</p>
<p>Did someone green-light this into production? This was not some brand-new startup breaking things and moving fast. This was a multi-billion dollar enterprise software company. If this is what they put into production, what's their internal decision making like? What's their QA process?</p>
<p>As a developer, seeing things like this in production makes that workplace seem like a dumpster fire. So if you do things like this, don't be surprised if people don't want to work for you.</p>
