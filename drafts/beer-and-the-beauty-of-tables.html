		<p>My grandfather was a machinist. He started out in the 1930&#8217;s working on
airplane engines and worked as a tool and die maker, moldmaker, and
millwright into the 1980&#8217;s. Even in retirement, he took odd jobs fixing
tractors and rebuilding various machine parts. Eventually, the time came
for him to get rid of a lot of his old tools. He gave me his old tool
chest that he had purchased and been using since the 1930&#8217;s. In the
middle of this chest is an odd-looking vertical drawer that would look
out of place in any modern tool chest. This strange vertical drawer was
designed (I believe) to hold a book called simply <a href="http://new.industrialpress.com/resources/history">&#8220;Machinery&#8217;s
Handbook&#8221;</a>. First
published in 1914, Machinery&#8217;s Handbook is a compendium of information
for machinists such as trigonometry, thread sizes, cutting speeds, feed
speeds, metal alloys, and more. Even a casual perusal of this book will
show you that much of this information is delivered in&nbsp;tables.</p>
<p>[Put image of table from <span class="caps">MH</span>&nbsp;here]</p>
<p>The beauty of printed tables is their simplicity of use; find the
column, find the row, find the value. You don&#8217;t need to train someone
how to use them, they don&#8217;t need batteries, and you can copy them, tape
them on things, and make notes in the&nbsp;margins.</p>
<p>The analog nature of &#8220;in-between&#8221; values makes tables seem out-of-place
in a world of screens&nbsp;with</p>
<p>Every bit that passes through a computer is fundamentally an analog
signal. It is only through our interpretation that the signal represents
a 1 or&nbsp;0</p>
<p>In brewing, there are a lot of formulas (mash pH, water chemistry,
original gravity, IBUs, hydrometer). Much of this can be handled by
software such as Beersmith or online calculators, but it&#8217;s hard to beat
the simplicity of printed&nbsp;tables.</p>
