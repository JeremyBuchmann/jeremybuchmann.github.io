		<p>My grandfather was a machinist. He started out in the 1930's working on
airplane engines and worked as a tool and die maker, moldmaker, and
millwright into the 1980's. Even in retirement, he took odd jobs fixing
tractors and rebuilding various machine parts. Eventually, the time came
for him to get rid of a lot of his old tools. He gave me his old tool
chest that he had purchased and been using since the 1930's. In the
middle of this chest is an odd-looking vertical drawer that would look
out of place in any modern tool chest. This strange vertical drawer was
designed (I believe) to hold a book called simply <a href="http://new.industrialpress.com/resources/history">"Machinery's
Handbook"</a>. First
published in 1914, Machinery's Handbook is a compendium of information
for machinists such as trigonometry, thread sizes, cutting speeds, feed
speeds, metal alloys, and more. Even a casual perusal of this book will
show you that much of this information is delivered in tables.</p>
<p>[Put image of table from MH here]</p>
<p>The beauty of printed tables is their simplicity of use; find the
column, find the row, find the value. You don't need to train someone
how to use them, they don't need batteries, and you can copy them, tape
them on things, and make notes in the margins.</p>
<p>The analog nature of "in-between" values makes tables seem out-of-place
in a world of screens with 20 digits of resolution.</p>
<p>In brewing, there are a lot of formulas (mash pH, water chemistry,
original gravity, IBUs, hydrometer corrections). Much of this can be handled by
software such as Beersmith or online calculators, but it's hard to beat
the simplicity of printed tables.</p>
